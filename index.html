            <h3>Renewable Resources:</h3>
            <p>
              Wind is a natural movement of air caused by temperature and pressure differences in the atmosphere, often harnessed as a renewable energy source.

            <h3>Non-Renewable Resources</h3>
            <p>
              Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, are non-renewable energy sources formed from ancient organic matter over millions of years, releasing significant energy but also greenhouse gases when burned.

            <h3>Natural Resources </h3>
            <p>
              Natural resources for ecosystem services, like forests, wetlands, and soil, provide essential benefits that sustain biodiversity, regulate climate, and support clean water and air, promoting ecological and human health.

        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <p>
          Supports Biodiversity: Environmental resources like forests and wetlands create habitats for countless species, promoting biodiversity.
          Climate Regulation: Resources like forests absorb carbon dioxide, helping reduce greenhouse gases and moderate global temperatures.
          Renewable Energy Potential: Solar, wind, and water resources offer cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels, reducing pollution and preserving the environment.
          Essential for Human Life: Water, clean air, and soil support agriculture, drinking water supplies, and overall human health.
          Ecosystem Services: Resources such as soil and water purify pollutants, prevent erosion, and contribute to water cycles, benefiting agriculture and urban areas.
          <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <p1>
          Resource Depletion: Overuse of non-renewable resources, like fossil fuels, leads to depletion and irreversible environmental damage.
Pollution and Habitat Loss: Extracting resources like minerals and fossil fuels can lead to habitat destruction, pollution, and loss of biodiversity.
Climate Impact: Exploiting fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change and its adverse effects on the environment.
Vulnerability to Overexploitation: Resources such as forests and fisheries are often overused, leading to ecosystem imbalance and reduced resource availability.
Economic Pressure on Conservation: Some resources, especially those that provide ecosystem services, are undervalued economically, leading to insufficient conservation efforts.
